Serpent Encryption Algorithm

"Serpent is a 128-bit block cipher designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard. It was a finalist in the AES competition. The winner, Rijndael, got 86 votes at the last AES conference while Serpent got 59 votes, Twofish 31 votes, RC6 23 votes and MARS 13 votes. So NIST's choice of Rijndael as the AES was not surprising, and we had to content ourselves with silver in the `encryption olympics'. Serpent and Rijndael are somewhat similar; the main difference is that Rijndael is faster (having fewer rounds) but Serpent is more secure. "
